description:
 This check measures and checks the number of requests
 per second and their status code handled by an Apache web
 server.

 A logfile reader daemon has to be installed on the
 Apache hosts to gather the statistics from tailing
 an Apache logfile, writing them to a spoolfile the Check_MK
 agent is able to pick up.

perfdata:
 Every HTTP status code generates a metric. They can be
 summarized by blocks of hundred.

 Automatically.
