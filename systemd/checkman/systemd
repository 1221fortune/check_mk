description:
 Check the current state of a systemd unit.
 This check becomes critical if the unit in question is not in the state it was
 when the service check was discovered.
 It is getting UNKNOWN if the service is missing on the system at all.

item:
 The name of the unit as string.

inventory:
 The inventory function of this check helps you to auto-detect the units
 that should be monitored on your hosts. Because Check_MK cannot know which
 units are important for you, you have to configure some rules.

 In the variable {inventory_systemd_rules} you specify a list of inventory
 declarations. The name of a unit. On every host that unit is loaded, a check
 for that service will be created during inventory.

 The string is interpreted as a regular expression matching the {beginning}
 of the service name.
